I live every day with the purpose and relentless determination to empower myself and others to discover and manifest their infinite potential.\n<br />\n<br />\nTo me, there is nothing more beautiful than to discover and manifest the potential of who I want to become and what I want to create, achieve, and give in this life.\n\nAnd on the contrary, there is nothing that I fear more than to leave my full potenital undiscovered and untapped.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n### **Currently**\n\nI am a Co-founder and the CEO at [Mindflow](/mindflow), where our mission is to inspire a generation of life-long doers to take joy in becoming 1% better every day. Currently, we are building a social app centered on personal growth. On Mindflow, you can embark on growth journeys that are meaningful to you, track your progress, and share the journey of becoming better every day with friends.\n<br />\n<br />\nI'm also the host of a podcast named [Inventing The Future](https://www.youtube.com/@inventing.the.future), where I interview visionary tech entrepreneurs that are solving the world's biggest problems. Every episode features the story of the guest, what they're building, and the mindsets, tools, & habits that enable them to thrive.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n### **Previously**\n\n- I was the Co-founder & CTO at Vize, which is a Glassdoor for factory workers in Mexico. The main goal here was to improve working conditions for factory workers and in turn lower the insanely high turnover rates that factories experienced (turnover as high as 100-400% of their workforce every year).\n- I was a Software Engineer at Meta (Facebook), LinkedIn, and Goldman Sachs\n  <br />\n  <br />\n\n### **Some history**\n\n- Born in San Antonio, Texas.\n- Moved to [Medell\xedn, Colombia](https://cdn.kimkim.com/files/a/content_articles/featured_photos/1ad949c863a201daf8589433b4b4f53dcea9bacb/big-2c865b81ba2b66d13bb814a304041332.jpg) 1 month after I was born. I lived there for 4 years.\n- At 4, I moved to [McAllen, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAllen,_Texas).\n- At 6, I started playing Tennis and played many competitive tournaments.\n- 6-14, I overdosed on video games. My favorites include FIFA, Runescape, World of Warcraft, Age of Mythology, Age of Empires 3, and League of Legends.\n- At 13, I was introduced to programming by one of my dad's friends. Together, we built a calculator application for the iPad (for some reason, the iPad did not come with a calculator when it first got released). From this experience, I became fascinated by the challenge of analyzing a situation or process to identify areas for improvement, employing my creativity to develop a software solution, and publishing the software to make it readily available to billions of users worldwide. I realized that programming is not just a tool - it is a platform for enacting meaningful change.\n- At 15, I developed an application named Widgets in Tabs for a school project, which got me featured on the [front cover of the local newspaper](https://www.yourconroenews.com/neighborhood/moco/news/article/Teen-develops-iTunes-app-Widget-Tabs-9261552.php).\n- At 16, I worked together with [The Texas Lyceum](https://www.texaslyceum.org/) and built 3 applications for their quarterly meetings. This was essentially my first job!\n- At 16, I also started an online eBay business where I bought items in bulk from China and resold them on eBay for a profit.\n- At 19, I went to my first Tony Robbins seminar: [Unleash The Power Within](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/unleash-the-power-within/). This seminar changed my life in many ways. The most significant impact came from redefining my vision and purpose in life to extend far beyond myself. I have since been propelled on a journey where I have been experiencing an exponential growth trajectory. At 21, I went to [Business Mastery](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/business-mastery/). At 22, I went to [Life & Wealth Mastery](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/life-wealth-mastery/) and [Date with Destiny](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/date-with-destiny/).\n- At 19, I transferred to Texas A&M University to pursue a Computer Science degree.\n- At 20, I became a co-founder of [Vize](https://incentivizinggood.com/), a startup with a mission to give low-skilled workers in developing countries a voice by allowing them to anonymously share their work experiences with their community.\n- At 22, I went on a silent retreat, where I experimented what would happen to The Mind when it became deprived of human interaction and technology for 5 days. You can listen to the reflection of my experience [here](https://infinitemindspodcast.com/2020/04/30/2-silent-retreat-reflection-the-infinite-journey-of-discovering-your-true-self/) .\n- At 23, I completed internships with LinkedIn and Facebook as a Software Engineer and decided to accept Facebook's offer. I also graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in computer science and survived COVID!\n- At 24, I fulfilled my dream of living in Silicon Valley when I moved to Palo Alto, California to start my full-time job at Meta (Facebook). I also started Mindflow in January 2022 and decided to leave my previous startup, Vize, to focus on Mindflow.\n- At 25, I decided to leave Meta after 9.5 months to go all in on Mindflow. I loved my job at Meta but in the end, Mindflow became an obsession and I felt that I was ready to be a full time founder.\n  <br />\n  <br />\n\n### **I enjoy**\n\n- **Sports:** Soccer, Tennis, Snowboarding, Ping Pong\n- **Professional Interests:** Entrepreneurship/Startups, Content Creation, Productivity, Product Management, Leading Others, Exponential Technologies (AI, Web 3, VR/AR, 3D Printing, etc.), Systems Thinking / Creating Systems, Programming\n- **Mentors:** Tony Robbins, Peter Diamandis, Elon Musk, August Bradley, Tim Ferriss, Keith Ferrazzi, Jim Kwik, Wim Hof, Naval Ravikant, Tom Bilyeu, Jordan Peterson, Simon Sinek, David Goggins, Shawn Stevenson, and many more.\n- **Personal Growth:** Reading, Journaling, Meditation, Fitness & Health, Learning & Learning How To Learn\n- **Podcasts:**([The Tim Ferris Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/), [Moonshots & Mindsets by Peter Diamandis](https://radicallyhonestpodcast.com/), [How I Built This](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this), [Impact Theory](https://impacttheory.com/), [Naval](https://nav.al/), [How to Start a Startup](https://player.fm/series/how-to-start-a-startup), [Kwik Brain with Jim Kwik](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kwik-brain-with-jim-kwik/id1208024744), and others)\n- [**Music**](https://open.spotify.com/user/126161110?si=80ma-a3bSpexjCqJ75TW-w): Flume, [Fred Again..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-hvjV2A5Y), [Above & Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEzU1HvBo6Y), [Ben B\xf6hmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvRhUHTV_8k), [Marsh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZLntv8hkQM), Seven Lions, Mac Miller, Drake, Travis Scott, Bad Bunny, J Balvin, Maluma, and so many more.\n- [Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2SGfMcemaM)\n- Life\n- Being Present\n- Deep conversations with fascinating people\n  <br />\n  <br />\n\n### **Fun facts**\n\n- I am a first-generation immigrant from [Medell\xedn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn), Colombia.
