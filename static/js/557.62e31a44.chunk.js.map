Antonio, Texas\n        because they were studying there at the time. <br />\n        <br />\n        We moved back to Medellin a month later after my parents finished their studies and lived\n        there for the first four years of my life until my parents decided to make the insane\n        decision to move back to the US and leave behind everything and everyone they had ever know\n        behind. A combination of push factors around violence in Colombia (Medellin is the city\n        Pablo Escobar was from) and pull factors around better economic opportunities, led my\n        parents to make this decision. <br />\n        <br />\n        We moved to McAllen, Texas, a small city in the southern tip of Texas (20 min from the\n        border to Mexico). This is the city where I grew up until I went to college at Texas A&M\n        University and studied computer science there. <br />\n        <br />I am now living in Palo Alto, California (Silicon Valley).\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <Image\n        src=\"/images/MedellinWithMe.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo of Julian in Medellin\"\n        margin=\"0 auto\"\n        mb=\"4px\"\n        borderRadius=\"12px\"\n        width={[\"100%\", \"70%\", \"70%\"]}\n      />\n      <Text\n        margin=\"0 auto\"\n        mb=\"30px\"\n        textAlign=\"center\"\n        fontSize=\"14px\"\n        color=\"rgba(117, 117, 117, 1)\"\n        width={[\"90%\", \"60%\", \"60%\"]}\n      >\n        Hanging out in the outskirts of Medellin (up in the mountains) or a recent trip during\n        Christmas 2022\n      </Text>\n      <Image\n        src=\"/images/Medellin2.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo of Medellin\"\n        margin=\"0 auto\"\n        mb=\"4px\"\n        borderRadius=\"12px\"\n        width={[\"100%\", \"70%\", \"70%\"]}\n      />\n      <Text mb=\"30px\" textAlign=\"center\" fontSize=\"14px\" color=\"rgba(117, 117, 117, 1)\">\n        Picture of Medellin\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        #1: The Discovery of My Purpose\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        I’ve experienced what it is like to want more from life but not have the mindsets or roadmap\n        needed to move in the right direction.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Ever since I can remember, I have felt an intense ambition burning within me. However, this\n        ambition initially manifested itself as a desire for wealth. For some reason, I just wanted\n        to be incredibly rich and successful.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        What I hadn’t realized at the time is that this ambition was very self-centered and\n        materialistic. My ambition lacked purpose and meaning. I have now learned that when you do\n        things purely or mostly out of self-interest, your motivation to take action is severely\n        limited.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Unsurprisingly, my behaviors were not aligned with the ambition I felt: I never read a book\n        unless I had to for school, I overdosed on video games, and I did not really care much about\n        my health.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I had the right intentions to work hard, but couldn’t get myself to consistently do what I\n        needed to do to achieve my dreams. In other words, there was a powerful Titan living within\n        me but he was deep asleep and locked by the chains of limiting beliefs.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Feeling this misalignment between my soaring ambition and my failure to take consistent\n        action was very painful. I have vivid memories of asking myself “Why am I not doing what I\n        intend to do? Am I really just going to live an ordinary life?”\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        But then one day, I discovered Tony Robbins and went to one of his live seminars,{\" \"}\n        <Link href=\"https://www.upwnow.com\" targe=\"_blank\">\n          Unleash The Power Within.\n        </Link>{\" \"}\n        I absorbed Tony’s wisdom on life like a sponge and felt that someone had finally given me a\n        map for how to navigate my life and equipped me with the mindsets needed to manifest my\n        potential and navigate challenging times. I grew exponentially during the seminar but the\n        most profound breakthrough was that I discovered a purpose that extends far beyond myself.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        After the seminar, everything changed: I started reading a lot more, I started to journal, I\n        stopped playing video games, I became extremely health conscious, and I worked harder than\n        ever before. For the first time in my life, I finally felt aligned with the ambition that I\n        had felt for so long. I had awakened the Titan within me and broken the chains that were\n        holding him back.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Image\n          src=\"/images/HoldingTonyBook.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Julian holding a book of Tony Robbins\"\n          margin=\"0 auto\"\n          mb=\"4px\"\n          borderRadius=\"12px\"\n          height={[\"400px\", \"500px\", \"500px\"]}\n        />\n        <Text\n          margin=\"0 auto\"\n          textAlign=\"center\"\n          fontSize=\"14px\"\n          color=\"rgba(117, 117, 117, 1)\"\n          width={[\"90%\", \"45%\", \"45%\"]}\n        >\n          My favorite Tony Robbins book, which succinctly communicates many of his core ideas in 100\n          pages.\n        </Text>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        This experience taught me that we all have so much more potential than we could ever\n        possibly imagine and that our potential is infinite.

Our lives are finite but life itself\n            is infinite. The game of life will continue with us or without us. This means that\n            there’s no such thing as winning life or being the best human. In an infinite game, the\n            pursuit of becoming better is better than the pursuit of becoming the best. And since\n            the pursuit of becoming better is infinite, our potential for growth is infinite.

An Infinite Mindset is an incredibly potent catalyst for growth.\n        Equip yourself with an Infinite Mindset.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        This understanding on potential revealed two critical and opposing personal truths.\n        <OrderedList ml=\"30px\">\n          <ListItem>\n            I believe that there is nothing more beautiful than to discover what you are capable of\n            becoming, achieving, creating, and giving in this life.\n          </ListItem>\n          <ListItem>\n            On the contrary, there is nothing more frightening than to leave your full potential\n            untapped.\n          </ListItem>\n        </OrderedList>\n        <br />\n        After realizing that every person has a boundless potential and that no one is completely\n        aware of the full nature of their potential (not even me), I became obsessed with figuring\n        out how how I could empower myself and others to discover and manifest their infinite\n        potential. And when I think about potential, I like to group it into the four buckets of\n        becoming, achieving, creating, and giving. This is what I articulate my purpose in life to\n        be.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I have since been to 6 Tony Robbins seminars, consumed countless books and courses on\n        personal growth, co-founded two companies (Mindflow & Vize), started a podcast (Inventing\n        The Future), and worked as a Software Engineer at Meta (Facebook), LinkedIn, and Goldman\n        Sachs.

It was therefore\n        a miracle that one of my Dad’s friends, Juan Carlos, happened to be a computer scientist.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        It was 2010 and the iPhone was starting to take the world by storm. Juan Carlos came up to\n        me one day and told me that if I ever had an idea for an app, we could build something\n        together and publish it on the App Store.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The idea of building an app fascinated me, especially since I became interested in tech due\n        to my obsession with video games and because I strongly desired to be rich at that time and\n        thought that this was the perfect opportunity to become a millionaire.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        After pitching several ideas, we decided to start with something simple so that we could\n        both learn: building a calculator for the iPad, which for some reason, to this day, does not\n        come with a calculator. We worked on the calculator and slowly over time the gibberish\n        looking lines of code started to make a little more sense.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        After releasing the calculator, we did not become millionaires, but we did manage to get\n        over 30,000 downloads. This experience had a profound impact on me because I got to\n        experience the process identifying a problem/need, coming up with a solution to address the\n        problem, building the tech with code, and publishing it on a platform that instantly made it\n        available to millions of people around the world. This experience taught me that programming\n        isn’t just a tool, it’s a platform for enacting meaningful change.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Image\n          src=\"/images/iCalculator.jpeg\"\n          alt=\"A screenshot of iCalculator on the App Store\"\n          margin=\"0 auto\"\n          mb=\"4px\"\n          borderRadius=\"12px\"\n          height={[\"450px\", \"600px\", \"600px\"]}\n        />\n        <Text textAlign=\"center\" fontSize=\"14px\" color=\"rgba(117, 117, 117, 1)\">\n          Screenshot of iCalculator on the App Store\n        </Text>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I ended up developing a couple of other apps during high school and decided to study\n        computer science at Texas A&M University.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        During college, I co-founded a startup named Vize and took on the role of being the CTO,\n        where I led 5 other engineers. Vize is a Glassdoor for factory workers in Mexico, with the\n        aim of improving the working conditions for low-income workers and lowering insanely high\n        turnover rates for factories (important context for later).\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        My junior year of college, I went hard preparing for technical interviews so that I could\n        land a great internship as a Software Engineer. After many rejections, I finally managed to\n        get an offer from Goldman Sachs. I spent the summer in NYC, loved the experience, and\n        decided to accept the full time offer I was given.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Now I was going into my final year of college with a great job lined up after graduation.\n        Having secured a job, school didn’t feel that important anymore, especially since it was\n        taking time away from working on Vize, which I felt was a much more valuable learning\n        experience and had a much greater potential for impact (homework doesn’t impact anyone other\n        than yourself).\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        As a result, I made the unethical decision to hire freelancers to do some of my homework the\n        last two semesters of college so that I could buy myself some time. Everything was going\n        smoothly until I received an email from the Honor System Office on the day of my last final\n        of my last semester (two weeks from graduation). They told me they wanted to speak with me\n        🧐\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        It turned out that one of the freelancers that saw my job post reported it to my university.\n        And I was smart enough to do two things 1) keep the name of the university on the assignment\n        2) use the same Upwork account with my real name that I had previously used for an eBay\n        business I used to run. As a result, there was no way to get out of it, the evidence was far\n        too compelling.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I confessed to the cheating and after having a hearing with the university where they would\n        decide my fate, I got suspended for a year and was given Fs in 6 classes, which dropped my\n        GPA from a 3.9 to a 2.8.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        My parents could not believe what I had done and to say they were disappointed and\n        frustrated is a huge understatement. For context, my parents are the most honest people that\n        I know and to my knowledge, have never made an ethical mistake. Additionally, they both have\n        PhDs and my mom is a professor at a University. In short, it was not a fun time.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Then I ended up telling Goldman Sachs what happened and after two excruciating weeks of\n        waiting to hear what their decision would be, they decided to rescind (retract) my full time\n        offer.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I ended up having to move back home with my parents and experience the full force of their\n        furry every day. I felt like the only thing I had left was my startup, Vize. Yet at that\n        time, things weren’t going well at all. We had been working on the startup for nearly two\n        years and had gotten close to no results. We had just lost two of our best engineers and the\n        others on the team weren’t investing much time into the startup. On top of that, my parents\n        thought I was wasting my time with the startup since it hadn’t amounted to anything.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        This was by far the toughest period in my life but I also knew that tough times create\n        incredible growth opportunities. This was also the perfect opportunity to put all the\n        personal growth from Tony Robbins’ seminars into practice.\n        <br />\n        <br />I did a 5 day silent retreat the day after my university decided to suspend me and\n        dove deep into my psyche, uncovering blind spots, reflecting on integrity and other values,\n        questioning why I did why I did, and how I could prevent something like this from happening\n        again in the future.

I wrote day and night and learned a ton about who I am.\n        </Text>\n        <br />\n        The major mindset shift happened when I realized that if I had to go back to school, this\n        would mean that I would have the opportunity to do more internships.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        After 4 months of coding like a maniac and 38 interviews with 19 companies, I ended up\n        getting offers from Meta (Facebook), LinkedIn, Google, and another company as a Software\n        Engineer. I decided to accept Meta and LinkedIn’s offer and did two back to back\n        internships. Both of these experiences were incredible and after receiving full time offers\n        from both, I decided to accept Meta’s offer.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I went back to college, finished my last semester, and then I moved to Palo Alto, California\n        when I started working at Meta. I left Vize in January of 2022 when I decided to start\n        Mindflow and after a whopping 9.5 months at Meta, I decided to leave to go all in on\n        Mindflow.\n        <br />\n        <br />I reflected deeply on this experience and learned so many things that continue to have\n        a significant impact in my life today.

However, I\n            realized that integrity is a non-negotiable value because it is the most important value\n            to preserve. I now think of integrity as the roots of a tree. It doesn’t matter how big\n            or strong a tree is, if it doesn’t have strong roots, the tree will end up falling\n            sooner or later when the wind blows strong enough. Similarly, it doesn’t matter how\n            smart or accomplished you are, if you don’t have a strong foundation of integrity,\n            people will lose trust in you and refuse to do business with you.\n          </ListItem>\n          <ListItem>\n            <b>The only failure is a failure to learn.</b> In life, we are going to fuck up and do\n            stupid shit.

In my mind, failure happens when you fail to take\n            the opportunity to reflect and learn from your mistakes and the things that went wrong.\n            When we get a 50 on a test, it’s common to be so frustrated by the results that the last\n            thing we want to do is look at what we did wrong.
