co-founded Mindflow in January 2022. Our mission is to inspire a generation of life-long\n        doers to take joy in becoming 1% better every day.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        This mission directly connects with my massively transformative purpose to empower myself\n        and others to discover and manifest their infinite potential.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I’m grateful to be on this journey with my brilliant co-founder, David Glass.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Image\n          src=\"images/DavidAndMe.jpg\"\n          alt=\"David and Julian\"\n          margin=\"0 auto\"\n          mb=\"30px\"\n          width={[\"100%\", \"70%\", \"70%\"]}\n          borderRadius=\"12px\"\n        />\n        Since we started Mindflow, we have tested out 5 different ideas. I’ll tell the story of\n        Mindflow by giving a brief overview on each of the ideas, why we pivoted, and the lessons we\n        gathered from each of them.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n      </Text>\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Idea #1: Learn-to-Earn — The Genesis of Mindflow\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        Mindflow was born out of an idea around a concept named learn-to-earn, which was inspired\n        from the boom of play-to-earn games, such as Axie Infinity.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        In a play to earn game like Axie Infinity, you can buy Axie NFTs and use them to play the\n        game and from playing the game, you earn a cryptocurrency named SLP. I invested in Axie by\n        sponsoring 20 people across the Philippines and Venezuela. This means that I bought the Axie\n        NFTs and let the scholars use them to play the game and in exchange we would split earnings.\n        In the beginning, this was very lucrative and these scholars in the Philippines and\n        Venezuela were making more money playing this game compared to almost any job they could\n        get.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I was mind blow by the economic opportunity this was creating but hated the fact that they\n        were playing video games. What if we could apply this same concept to something a bit more\n        productive, such as learning? Thus, the idea for learn-to-earn was born.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        We launched our MVP for the learn-to-earn platform in March of 2022. The basic idea is that\n        you read text from a learning lesson, respond to a reflection question based on what you\n        learned and if we approve your response (based on it not being spam), you will earn 100\n        points, which equates to $0.50 worth of the MATIC cryptocurrency.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        In this MVP, we were paying users out of pocket and losing money but we were only doing this\n        while testing the initial idea and our plan was to eventually adopt an economic model\n        similar to that of Axie Infinity. The platform is still live and you can{\" \"}\n        <Link href=\"https://www.learn.mindflow.gg\" target=\"_blank\">\n          check it out here\n        </Link>\n        .

However, these are some of the reasons as to why we decided to pivot.\n        <OrderedList>\n          <ListItem>\n            <b>Uncertainty in the Economic Model:</b> Our economic model was very similar to Axie\n            Infinity’s but Axie Infinity was crashing at the moment and it’s long term\n            sustainability was uncertain (Axle’s crypto SLP has dropped more than 99% since its\n            peak).\n          </ListItem>\n          <ListItem>\n            <b>Intrinsic {\">\"} Extrinsic Motivation:</b> Paying people to learn is an extrinsic\n            motivation to learn. We ended up reading research on how extrinsic motivators, such as\n            money, can often get in the way of someone’s intrinsic motivation to want to do\n            something. In other words, if you are being paid to do something, you are likely to\n            believe that you are doing that thing for money rather than because you actually enjoy\n            it. As a result, we were afraid that creating extrinsic motivations around learning\n            could be harmful.

You get points for completing\n        quests and when the competition ends, the participants at the top of the leaderboard would\n        earn different amounts of money. The main idea was to make it fun and easy for growth-driven\n        people to take action and become a better version of themselves, with a community of other\n        like-minded individuals.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        After running 2 seasons of the Mindflow Games (which we ran using Notion) with 48\n        participants that paid $25 to participate and completed an aggregate of over 400 quests, we\n        learned that the convenience and social elements were both the most impactful motivators in\n        taking action and the most enjoyable parts of the experience.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Therefore, when we decided to dial up the social and convenience factors of the experience\n        by creating a social app that gave users daily quests.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        This pivot, just like the last, did not happen because what we were doing was not working\n        but rather because we identified what we believed to be a much bigger and better\n        opportunity.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        You can check out a demo of how the Mindflow Games works{\" \"}\n        <Link href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/33b003feb3184bd9b6d91dcfdd0497e6\" target=\"_blank\">\n          here\n        </Link>\n        .\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        We also managed to raise $220k for our pre-seed round around this time.\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Idea #3: Growth Made Social — The Mindflow App\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        After going into full build mode, we ended up launching the Mindflow app in August 2022.

When we\n        spoke with users, many mentioned they wanted the flexibility to grow in the ways that were\n        meaningful to them.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        As a result, we launched Growth Journeys within the Mindflow App\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Idea #4: Growth Journeys\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        Growth Journeys is a feature within the Mindflow app that enables you to create a growth\n        journey for anything you want to grow in, such as Running, Weightlifting, Reading, Learning\n        Spanish, etc. The idea is to have a space for you to document your hobbies, track your\n        progress, learning efforts, and mental growth all in one spot and share the journey of\n        becoming better every day with friends.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        We launched Growth Journeys in Oct 2022 and after 3 months, it still hasn't generated good\n        traction.\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Mini retrospective on the Mindflow App\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        We launched Mindflow on August 20th, 2022 (4 months from time of writing) and since then,\n        there has been over over 700 downloads and 500 posts created. Retention is only good (1+\n        month) for a very small percentage of users and almost all users churn after 2 months. And\n        perhaps worst of all for a social app, users were not inviting their friends.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        When we talked to users, there are things that they found valuable from the experience but\n        overall, it appears that what we have built is a vitamin rather than a pain killer (our\n        product is a nice to have).\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        There’s a lot of mistakes we have made that led to this result but perhaps one of the\n        biggest one is that we failed to nail down on a specific pain point and build a solution\n        that does an exceptional job of tackling that pain point. This mistake is a painful one\n        because it’s a failure to apply and internalize one of the most fundamental startup\n        principles.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        As a result, we decided to take a step back and brainstorm different potential directions we\n        could take and ideas we could test out. If you’d like an overview of the creative process\n        behind how my co-founder and I came up with 240 different ideas and narrowed it down to one\n        idea to test out,{\" \"}\n        <Link\n          href=\"https://twitter.com/InfiniteJuliaan/status/1602400809987149824?s=20\"\n          targe=\"_blank\"\n        >\n          check out this thread on Twitter\n        </Link>\n        .\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Idea #5: Sparkin Joy — Connecting the World Through Gratitude\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        The first idea we decided to test out after brainstorming a lot of different ideas is called\n        Sparkin Joy. The idea here is that you can write a gratitude letter to someone you care\n        about and when you do so, a “gratitude chain” is created. If you receive a gratitude letter,\n        you have 48 hours to send a gratitude letter to someone new before the chain breaks. The\n        goal is to keep the chain alive for as long as possible.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The core assumption here is that if you receive a gratitude letter, you’ll feel so grateful\n        that you will want to pay it forward and send a gratitude letter to someone else\n        (reciprocity).\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Additionally, we think there is power in creating the space and inviting someone to express\n        gratitude to someone else. Often times we feel grateful but we don’t express it. And feeling\n        gratitude for someone but not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it to\n        someone\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        We launched Sparkin Joy in late Dec 2022 (few days as of this writing) and are currently\n        testing our initial MVP to see how likely people are to keep gratitude chains alive. If more\n        than 25% of chains are still alive after 10 days, we’ll invest further into this idea.\n        Otherwise, we’ll go back to the drawing board and experiment with another idea.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        You can check out the live MVP of SparkinJoy and write a gratitude letter to someone at\n        <Link href=\"https://sparkinjoy.com\" targe=\"_blank\">\n          https://sparkinjoy.com\n        </Link>\n        .\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Closing Thoughts\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        This is the beauty and challenge of the 0 to 1 journey!\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        One of my biggest lessons along this journey has been that it often takes many iterations to\n        find product-market fit. This means that it’s important to minimize your burn rate so that\n        you can survive long enough to have enough shots on goal until you manage to score.
