Having a\n          podcast is a great way to exercise and nuture these skills. The reason a podcast is such a\n          good tool for improving these skills is because when you are having a conversation with\n          someone, you are so focused on trying to figure out WHAT to say, that you pay little\n          attention to HOW you are saying it. But when you hear back the recording of your own\n          voice, you can pay full attention to HOW you communicated.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          <b>Building a Personal Brand:</b> I've learned to value the importance of building a\n          personal brand because everything becomes easier with a better personal brand. Any time\n          you launch something new (product, book, podcast, etc.) the first people that are going to\n          check it out and support you is the people in your personal and professional network. A\n          podcast is a great way to gain an audience and build credibility.\n        </ListItem>\n      </OrderedList>\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Where to Listen?\n      </Heading>\n\n      <OrderedList mb=\"24px\">\n        <ListItem>\n          <Link href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@inventing.the.future\" target=\"_blank\">\n            YouTube (high quality video production recorded in a studio)\n          </Link>\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          <Link href=\"https://bit.ly/itf-apple\" target=\"_blank\">\n            Apple Podcasts\n          </Link>\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          <Link href=\"https://bit.ly/itf-spotify\" target=\"_blank\">\n            Spotify\n          </Link>\n        </ListItem>\n      </OrderedList>\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Socials\n      </Heading>\n      <Text mb=\"6px\">\n        Follow our socials for content on startup & tech wisdom + news, including but not\n        exclusively snippets from podcast interviews\n      </Text>\n      <HStack mb=\"30px\">\n        <Button\n          as=\"a\"\n          leftIcon={<FaTiktok />}\n          href=\"https://tiktok.com/@inventing.the.future\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n        >\n          TikTok\n        </Button>\n        <Button\n          as=\"a\"\n          leftIcon={<FaInstagram />}\n          href=\"https://www.instagram.com/inventing.the.future\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n        >\n          Instagram\n        </Button>\n        <Button as=\"a\" leftIcon={<FaTwitter />} href=\"https://twitter.com/ITFpod\" target=\"_blank\">\n          Twitter\n        </Button>\n        <Button\n          as=\"a\"\n          leftIcon={<FaYoutube />}\n          href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@inventing.the.future\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n        >\n          YouTube\n        </Button>\n        <Button\n          as=\"a\"\n          leftIcon={<FaLinkedin />}\n          href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/inventingthefuture\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n        >\n          LinkedIn\n        </Button>\n      </HStack>\n\n      {/* <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Newsletter\n      </Heading>\n      <p>\n        Subscribe to my newsletter to recieve updates on new episodes.
