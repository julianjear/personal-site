  <Text>\n        I co-founded Wisdolia in January 2022. We've pivoted 4 times since we started the company\n        and are currently working on Wisdolia, where we're building an AI learning copilot that\n        turns any study material into an interactive, personalized, and fun learning experience. We\n        started off by creating a Chrome extension that uses AI to generate flashcards with\n        questions and answers for any article, PDF, or YouTube video.

I’ll tell the story of\n        Wisdolia by giving a brief overview on each of the ideas, why we pivoted, and the lessons we\n        gathered from each of them.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n      </Text>\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Idea #1: Learn-to-Earn — The Genesis of Wisdolia\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        Mindflow was the name of the first idea that gave birth to the company and it was based on a\n        concept named learn-to-earn. Learn-to-earn was inspired from the explosion of play-to-earn\n        games, such as Axie Infinity.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        In a play to earn game like Axie Infinity, you can buy Axie NFTs and use them to play the\n        game and from playing the game, you earn a cryptocurrency named SLP. I invested in Axie by\n        sponsoring 20 people across the Philippines and Venezuela. This means that I bought the Axie\n        NFTs and let the scholars use them to play the game and in exchange we would split earnings.\n        In the beginning, this was very lucrative and these scholars in the Philippines and\n        Venezuela were making more money playing this game compared to almost any job they could\n        get.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I was mind blow by the economic opportunity this was creating but felt uncomfortable that\n        they were playing a video game, which wasn't helping them in any real way. What if we could\n        apply this same concept to something a bit more productive, such as learning? Thus, the idea\n        for learn-to-earn was born.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        We launched our MVP for the learn-to-earn platform in March of 2022. The basic idea is that\n        you read text from a learning lesson, respond to a reflection question based on what you\n        learned and if we approve your response (based on it not being spam), you would earn 100\n        points, which equates to $0.50 worth of the MATIC cryptocurrency.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        In this MVP, we were paying users out of pocket and losing money but we were only doing this\n        while testing the initial idea and our plan was to eventually adopt an economic model\n        similar to that of Axie Infinity. The platform is still live and you can{\" \"}\n        <Link href=\"https://www.learn.mindflow.gg\" target=\"_blank\">\n          check it out here\n        </Link>\n        .

However, these are some of the reasons as to why we decided to pivot.\n        <OrderedList>\n          <ListItem>\n            <b>Uncertainty in the Economic Model:</b> Our economic model was very similar to Axie\n            Infinity’s but Axie Infinity was crashing at the moment and it’s long term\n            sustainability was uncertain (Axle’s crypto SLP has dropped more than 99% since its\n            peak).\n          </ListItem>\n          <ListItem>\n            <b>Intrinsic {\">\"} Extrinsic Motivation:</b> Paying people to learn is an extrinsic\n            motivation to learn. We ended up reading research on how extrinsic motivators, such as\n            money, can often get in the way of someone’s intrinsic motivation to want to do\n            something. In other words, if you are being paid to do something, you are likely to\n            believe that you are doing that thing for money rather than because you actually enjoy\n            it. As a result, we were afraid that creating extrinsic motivations around learning\n            could be harmful.

We therefore\n            wanted to build something that had a greater emphasis on taking action.\n          </ListItem>\n          <ListItem>\n            <b>Low-Income People:</b> The people that resonated with this product the most were\n            low-income people in developing countries.

The main idea was to make it fun and easy for growth-driven\n        people to take action and become a better version of themselves, with a community of other\n        like-minded individuals.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        After running 2 seasons of the Mindflow Games (which we ran using Notion) with 48\n        participants that paid $25 to participate and completed an aggregate of over 400 quests, we\n        learned that the convenience and social elements were both the most impactful motivators in\n        taking action and the most enjoyable parts of the experience.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Therefore, we decided to dial up the social and convenience factors of the experience by\n        creating a social app that gave users daily quests.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        You can check out a demo of how the Mindflow Games worked{\" \"}\n        <Link href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/33b003feb3184bd9b6d91dcfdd0497e6\" target=\"_blank\">\n          here\n        </Link>\n        .\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        We also managed to raise $220k for our pre-seed round around this time.\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Idea #3: Growth Made Social — The Mindflow App\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        After going into full build mode, we ended up launching the Mindflow app in August 2022.

When we\n        spoke with users, many mentioned they wanted the flexibility to grow in the ways that were\n        meaningful to them.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        As a result, we launched Growth Journeys within the Mindflow App\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Idea #4: Growth Journeys\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        Growth Journeys is a feature within the Mindflow app that enables you to create and share a\n        collection of posts for anything you want to grow in, such as Running, Weightlifting,\n        Reading, Learning Spanish, etc. The idea is to have a space for you to document your\n        passions/hobbies, track your progress, learning efforts, and mental growth all in one spot\n        and share the journey of becoming better every day with friends.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        We launched Growth Journeys in Oct 2022 and after 3 months, it still hadn't generated good\n        traction so we decided to pivot.\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Mini retrospective on the Mindflow App\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        We launched Mindflow on August 20th, 2022 and after deciding to pivot 6 months later, there\n        had been ~900 downloads and 500 posts created. Retention was only good (1+ month) for a very\n        small percentage of users and almost all users churned after 2 months. And perhaps worst of\n        all for a social app, users were not inviting their friends.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        When we talked to users, there are things that they found valuable from the experience but\n        overall, it appears that what we had built was a vitamin rather than a pain killer (meaning\n        that our product is a nice to have rather than a must have).\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        There’s a lot of mistakes we have made that led to this result but perhaps one of the\n        biggest one is that we failed to nail down on a specific pain point and build a solution\n        that does an exceptional job of tackling that pain point. This mistake is a painful one\n        because it’s a failure to apply and internalize one of the most fundamental startup\n        principles.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        As a result, we decided to take a step back and brainstorm different potential directions we\n        could take and ideas we could test out.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        You can check out a full post-mortem with a reflection on the top 4 mistakes we made with\n        the Mindflow app{\" \"}\n        <Link\n          href=\"https://mindflowgg.notion.site/Mindflow-Social-App-Post-Mortem-305b22742b8b4882bc9d04842d0e2091\"\n          targe=\"_blank\"\n        >\n          here\n        </Link>\n        .\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Idea #5: Sparkin Joy — Connecting the World Through Gratitude\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        The idea with Sparkin Joy was that you could write a gratitude letter to someone you care\n        about and when you do so, a “gratitude chain” is created. If you receive a gratitude letter,\n        you have 48 hours to send a gratitude letter to someone new before the chain breaks. The\n        goal is to keep the chain alive for as long as possible.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The core assumption here is that if you receive a gratitude letter, you’ll feel so grateful\n        that you will want to pay it forward and send a gratitude letter to someone else\n        (reciprocity).\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        We tested out SparkinJoy but after two weeks, we did not get enough positive signal so we\n        decided to move past this idea as well.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        You can check out Sparkin Joy at{\" \"}\n        <Link href=\"https://sparkinjoy.com\" targe=\"_blank\">\n          https://sparkinjoy.com\n        </Link>\n        .\n      </Text>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n\n      <Heading as=\"h3\" size=\"md\" mb=\"12px\">\n        Idea #6: Wisdolia\n      </Heading>\n      <Text>\n        Wisdolia is what we're currently working on and it's finally the first idea that is working\n        really well (10,000s of users)!

We\n        started off by creating a Chrome extension that uses AI to generate flashcards with\n        questions and answers for any article, PDF, or YouTube video. It has proven to be extremely\n        valuable for students because of how much time it saves them from having to create\n        flashcards.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Overall, we’re excited about Wisdolia and the potential of what it could become.
