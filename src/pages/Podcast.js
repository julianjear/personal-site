          "The world's biggest problems are the world's biggest opportunities" - Peter Diamandis.
          After acquiring this sage wisdom from Peter, I became interested in learning about the
          world's biggest problem and increasing the awareness of these problems to young entreneurs
          that want to make a dent in the universe.

          There are several great podcast on entrepreneurship (such as How I Built This) but I
          personally wanted a podcast that 1) focused specifically on tech entrepreneurship and 2)
          was hosted by someone that was an entrepreneur themselves. I couldn't find a podcast like
          this so I decided to do it myself!

          <b>Super Networking Tool:</b> Having a podcast is a good excuse to talk to incredible
          people and the people I was most interested in connecting with is tech founders.

          <b>Mastering Communication:</b> I came to realize that the ability to community well and
          ask good questions are two of the most important skills to master in life. Having a
          podcast is a great way to exercise and nuture these skills. The reason a podcast is such a
          good tool for improving these skills is because when you are having a conversation with
          someone, you are so focused on trying to figure out WHAT to say, that you pay little
          attention to HOW you are saying it. But when you hear back the recording of your own
          voice, you can pay full attention to HOW you communicated.

        <ListItem>
          <b>Building a Personal Brand:</b> I've learned to value the importance of building a
          personal brand because everything becomes easier with a better personal brand. Any time
          you launch something new (product, book, podcast, etc.) the first people that are going to
          check it out and support you is the people in your personal and professional network. A
          podcast is a great way to gain an audience and build credibility.
