        In January 2021, I launched the Inventing The Future podcast. These are a few of the reasons
        why I decided to do so...

        <li>
          "The world's biggest problems are the world's biggest opportunities" - Peter Diamandis.
          After acquiring this sage wisdom from Peter, I became interested in learning about the
          world's biggest problem and increasing the awareness of these problems to young entreneurs
          that want to make a dent in the universe.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are several great podcast on entrepreneurship (such as How I Built This) but I
          personally wanted a podcast that 1) focused specifically on tech entrepreneurship and 2)
          was hosted by someone that was an entrepreneur themselves. I couldn't find a podcast like
          this so I decided to do it myself!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Super Networking Tool:</b> Having a podcast is a good excuse to talk to incredible
          people and the people I was most interested in connecting with is tech founders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mastering Communication:</b> I came to realize that the ability to community well and
          ask good questions are two of the most important skills to master in life. Having a
          podcast is a great way to exercise and nuture these skills. The reason a podcast is such a
          good tool for improving these skills is because when you are having a conversation with
          someone, you are so focused on trying to figure out WHAT to say, that you pay little
          attention to HOW you are saying it. But when you hear back the recording of your own
          voice, you can pay full attention to HOW you communicated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Building a Personal Brand:</b> I've learned to value the importance of building a
          personal brand because everything becomes easier with a better personal brand. Any time
          you launch something new (product, book, podcast, etc.) the first people that are going to
          check it out and support you is the people in your personal and professional network. A
          podcast is a great way to gain an audience and build credibility.

        <strong>Here is the show description of the podcast:</strong>
        <br />
        The potential for entrepreneurs to disrupt industries and solve problems on a massive scale
        has never been greater. The decreased cost and increased power of technology has{" "}
        democratized our ability to solve large-scale problems. Today, a single individual or team,
        driven by a purpose, can transform our world. Our mission is to inspire and empower
        entrepreneurs to solve the world's biggest problems. Join me, a growing entrepreneur and
        computer scientist, as I interview those that are inventing our future. The best way to
        predict the future is to invent it. <br />
        How will you invent the future?{" "}

      <h3>Podcast Slack Community</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
          There are two primary reasons why I created a Slack community for this podcast.
        </strong>{" "}
        <br />
        1. Podcasts often discuss really interesting topics but the conversations are usually one{" "}
        directional, which means that they go from the host/guests to the listener. In this{" "}
        community, we'll keep the conversation from the topics discussed in the podcast going. This
        means you'll be able to have conversations with the host (me) and other listeners related to
        the topics discussed in the episodes. <br />
        2. If you really enjoy a podcast, it is likely that you would relate well with other
        listeners that also enjoy the podcast. This podcast community creates a space where you can
        meet, engage with, learn from, and potentially collaborate with other like-minded
        entrepreneurs. <br />
        <br />
        If you are passionate about entrepreneurship and would like to learn from and connect with
        other ambitious entrepreneurs, I invite you to join the community and share anything related
        to entrepreneurship that you think would be valuable to others. <br />
        Let's invent the future, together.
