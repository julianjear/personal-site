        <strong>Here is the show description of the podcast:</strong>
        <br />
        The potential for entrepreneurs to disrupt industries and solve problems on a massive scale
        has never been greater. The decreased cost and increased power of technology has{" "}
        democratized our ability to solve large-scale problems. Today, a single individual or team,
        driven by a purpose, can transform our world. Our mission is to inspire and empower
        entrepreneurs to solve the world's biggest problems. Join me, a growing entrepreneur and
        computer scientist, as I interview those that are inventing our future. The best way to
        predict the future is to invent it. <br />
        How will you invent the future?{" "}

      <h3>Podcast Slack Community</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
          There are two primary reasons why I created a Slack community for this podcast.
        </strong>{" "}
        <br />
        1. Podcasts often discuss really interesting topics but the conversations are usually one{" "}
        directional, which means that they go from the host/guests to the listener. In this{" "}
        community, we'll keep the conversation from the topics discussed in the podcast going. This
        means you'll be able to have conversations with the host (me) and other listeners related to
        the topics discussed in the episodes. <br />
        2. If you really enjoy a podcast, it is likely that you would relate well with other
        listeners that also enjoy the podcast. This podcast community creates a space where you can
        meet, engage with, learn from, and potentially collaborate with other like-minded
        entrepreneurs. <br />
        <br />
        If you are passionate about entrepreneurship and would like to learn from and connect with
        other ambitious entrepreneurs, I invite you to join the community and share anything related
        to entrepreneurship that you think would be valuable to others. <br />
        Let's invent the future, together.
