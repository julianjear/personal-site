# Intro

I graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in Computer Science; however, my curiosity extends far beyond 1s and 0s. I also love entrepreneurship and business, mainly because they are platforms through which I can extend the impact of my mission. I enjoy using my passions, skills, creativity, aptitude for learning, and unique background to continue pushing the boundaries of what I am capable of so that I can maximize the value I contribute to the Universe.

# Purpose

I believe that every one of us has a potential of such an extreme magnitude, that most of us are unaware of what we are truly capable of. I live every day with the purpose and relentless determination to empower myself and others to discover and manifest their infinite potential.

# Currently

I am a co-founder and the CTO of a startup named [Vize](https://www.vize.mx/acerca-de-nosotros) (short for Incentivizing Good), which is a Glassdoor for low skilled workers in developing countries. I will start working at Facebook as a Software Engineer in June 2021. At Vize, I wear many different hats. For example, I'm a full-stack developer, co-lead the engineering and the marketing teams, make sales calls to factories, plan product roadmaps and sprints, define and continuously track our key success metrics, and develop the company's culture.

# Some history

- Born in San Antonio, Texas.
- Moved to [Medellín, Colombia](https://cdn.kimkim.com/files/a/content_articles/featured_photos/1ad949c863a201daf8589433b4b4f53dcea9bacb/big-2c865b81ba2b66d13bb814a304041332.jpg) 1 month after I was born. I lived there for 4 years.
- At 4, I moved to [McAllen, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAllen,_Texas).
- At 6, I started playing Tennis and played many competitive tournaments.
- 6-14, I overdosed on video games. My favorites include FIFA, Runescape, World of Warcraft, Age of Mythology, Age of Empires 3, and League of Legends.
- At 13, I was introduced to programming by one of my dad's friends. Together, we built a calculator application for the iPad (for some reason, the iPad did not come with a calculator when it first got released). From this experience, I became fascinated by the challenge of analyzing a situation or process to identify areas for improvement, employing my creativity to develop a software solution, and publishing the software to make it readily available to billions of users worldwide. I realized that programming is not just a tool - it is a platform for enacting meaningful change.
- At 15, I developed an application named Widgets in Tabs for a school project, which got me featured on the [front cover of the local newspaper](https://www.yourconroenews.com/neighborhood/moco/news/article/Teen-develops-iTunes-app-Widget-Tabs-9261552.php).
- At 16, I worked together with [The Texas Lyceum](https://www.texaslyceum.org/) and built 3 applications for their quarterly meetings. This was essentially my first job!
- At 16, I also started an online eBay business where I bought items in bulk from China and resold them on eBay for a profit.
- At 17, I became the captain of my high school's varsity soccer team.
- At 18, I hired my first employee for my online eBay business.
- At 19, I went to my first Tony Robbins seminar: [Unleash The Power Within](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/unleash-the-power-within/). This seminar changed my life in many ways. The most significant impact came from redefining my vision and purpose in life to extend far beyond myself. I have since been propelled on a journey where I have been experiencing an exponential growth trajectory. At 21, I went to [Business Mastery](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/business-mastery/). At 22, I went to [Life & Wealth Mastery](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/life-wealth-mastery/) and [Date with Destiny](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/date-with-destiny/).
- At 19, I transferred to Texas A&M University to pursue a Computer Science degree.
- At 20, I became a co-founder of [Vize](https://incentivizinggood.com/), a startup with a mission to give low-skilled workers in developing countries a voice by allowing them to anonymously share their work experiences with their community.
- At 22, I went on a silent retreat, where I experimented what would happen to The Mind when it became deprived of human interaction and technology for 5 days. You can listen to the reflection of my experience [here](https://infinitemindspodcast.com/2020/04/30/2-silent-retreat-reflection-the-infinite-journey-of-discovering-your-true-self/) .
- At 23, I completed internships with LinkedIn and Facebook as a Software Engineer and decided to accept Facebook's offer, where I will start working with them in June 2021. I also graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in computer science and survived COVID!
